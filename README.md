Barebone theme for [Hexo](http://zespia.tw/hexo) implemented with [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/). The current Hexo theme list does not have anything other than ejs themes. I made this as a starting point for anyone who is interested in theming using Jade.  

## Installation

Get to your Hexo directory and install the dependencies first.

```shell
npm install hexo-renderer-jade --save
npm install hexo-renderer-less --save
```

Clone this repository to your Hexo themes folder and modify `theme` in `_config.yml` to `jade-barebone`.

```shell
git clone git://github.com/widatama/hexo-jade-barebone.git themes/jade-barebone
```
